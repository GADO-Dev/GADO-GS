## 📝 Abstract

> 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity, real-time novel view synthesis by modeling scenes with explicit parametric primitives. However, the joint optimization of geometry and appearance in vanilla 3DGS often introduces geometry-appearance ambiguity: high-frequency SH coefficients tend to overfit to incorrect positions, trapping the optimization in local minima characterized by "texture-baked" artifacts and slow convergence. 
>
> In this paper, we propose **GADO-GS**, a framework achieving minute-level convergence by disentangling geometry from appearance. Instead of a unified update rule, we impose distinct scheduling trajectories to establish structural stability before textural refinement. This "structure-first" evolution is effectively stabilized by temporal spectral filtering of high-frequency harmonics. Furthermore, we leverage multi-view consistency as a feedback signal for adaptive density control, ensuring geometric compactness by eliminating incoherent artifacts. 
>
> Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks & Temples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our approach accelerates training by over **7×** on average and rendering by **4.5×** while surpassing state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.
